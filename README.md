System of Linear Equations (Simultaneous Equations)

A system of linear equations is a collection of linear equations which involve the same set of variables.

For example: ``x + (2 * y) = 2`` and ``-x + y == 1   )``

System of equations with two variables: x and y.
Possible solution: x = 0, y = 1

The solution to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables that satisfy every equation in the system. For a given system, we could have one solution, no solutions or infinitely many solutions.

``git clone [github repo link]``

Run script with upper and lower bounds arguments to the script:
``python main.py -10 10``

Observe the conputational steps taken to arrive at a singular solution.
